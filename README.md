# 🎓 StudentAID - My First Mobile App Adventure!

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

**StudentAID** is a mobile app I built specifically for Android devices, and it was a major milestone for me! This was the first time I ventured into mobile app development, and it really pushed me out of my comfort zone. The app’s goal is to help students by offering multiple ways to get study-related help whether it’s through typing, speaking, or even snapping a picture. I also integrated a library finder using GPS and Google Maps, which was another first for me.

The project gave me hands-on experience with mobile-specific challenges, like designing for smaller screens, handling GPS, and ensuring smooth performance on Android devices. Building this app helped me understand just how different mobile development is compared to desktop applications, and it opened my eyes to the incredible potential of mobile technology. It was a huge learning experience, and I’m proud of how far I’ve come since I started.
